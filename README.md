## Self Reflections
- > I thoroughly enjoyed the process of learning JavaScript. I learned quite a lot of things: including variables and operators, different data types and conditionals, proper usage of the javascript developer tools, basics of functions, how to actually do problem-solving (the 3-stage process) and understanding errors.
