## Self Reflections
- > I thoroughly enjoyed the process of learning JavaScript. I learned quite a lot of things: including variables and operators, different data types and conditionals, proper usage of the javascript developer tools, basics of functions, how to actually do problem-solving (the 3-stage process) and understanding errors.

- > This is probably the only update needed. I added a GUI to the console based version of this game to make it look pretty. I also learned quite a bit about writing clean code and commenting, installing Node.js, arrays and loops, using event listeners to manipulate the DOM and finally how to make use of git branches.

[^2]: The [TOP strategy guide](https://dev.to/theodinproject/learning-code-f56) makes it clear to [focus on the point of the assignment](https://dev.to/theodinproject/learning-code-f56#:~:text=Focus%20on%20the%20point%20of%20the%20assignment) and that [foundations isn't a strong portfolio generator](https://dev.to/theodinproject/learning-code-f56#:~:text=Foundations%20isn%E2%80%99t%20a%20strong%20portfolio%20generator), so I won't be wasting anymore time here.
